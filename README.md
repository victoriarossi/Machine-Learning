## About the Course

Linear algebraic foundations of machine learning featuring real-world applications of matrix methods from classification and clustering to denoising and data analysis. 
Mathematical topics include: linear equations, regression, regularization, the singular value decomposition, and iterative algorithms. 
Machine learning topics include: the lasso, support vector machines, kernel methods, clustering, dictionary learning, neural networks, and deep learning. 
Previous exposure to numerical computing (e.g. Matlab, Python, Julia, R) required.
